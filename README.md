# Sentence-Completion

Sentence completion is a fundamental task in natural language processing and understanding. Sentence completion requires predicting the most appropriate word or phrase to fill in the blank given some prior portion of the sentence. Since any given word in a sentence has a direct connection with its neighbouring words, sentence completion requires the understanding of grammar, semantics, and contextual information. The applications of a sentence completion model are numerous, from language modelling and text generation to content recommendation and sentiment analysis.  
Our goal is to find the best performing classical machine learning model on the HellaSwag dataset by comparing various previously studied techniques and try to come up with our own novel approach if possible.
